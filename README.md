# Computer Vision Assignments

This repository contains the worked solutions to assignments from the course ECE 471: Computer Vision, offered at the University of Victoria.
The solutions, but not the templates, are my own work, and are not to be used in whole or in part for any purpose by anyone.
The assignment specification documents are the work of the course runners, not mine.
I did not design the assignments themselves. This repository is for documentation and storage purposes only.
